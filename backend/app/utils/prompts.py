# BIAS JUDGE PROMPT
# =============================================================================

BIAS_JUDGE_PROMPT = """
You are an expert in media analysis and bias detection.

Your task: Analyze the following historical content for neutrality and potential bias.

CONTENT TO ANALYZE:
{content}

Please evaluate the content and return a JSON response in this format:
{{
  "bias_score": <a number from 0.0 to 100.0>,
  "explanation": "A detailed explanation of your analysis"
}}

Where:
- 0-20: Highly neutral and objective
- 21-40: Mostly neutral with minor bias
- 41-60: Balanced but with noticeable bias
- 61-80: Significantly biased
- 81-100: Extremely biased

Evaluation criteria:
1. **Loaded Language:** Check for emotionally charged adjectives or adverbs that inject opinion
2. **Framing:** Assess if events are presented from a single perspective or multiple viewpoints
3. **Attribution:** Look for one-sided attribution of motives or blame
4. **Omissions:** Note important facts or perspectives that are absent
5. **Evidence:** Check if claims are supported or merely asserted
6. **Neutrality:** Consider if the tone maintains professional distance or leans persuasive

Return ONLY the JSON object with bias_score (float) and explanation (string), no additional text.
